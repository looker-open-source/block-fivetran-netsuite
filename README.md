## Purpose Of This Block ##
The Fivetran block for Netsuite lets you easily visualize and analyze your Netsuite data.

NetSuite, a leading ERP tool, enables users to manage key aspects of their business in one place.

In-tool reporting with NetSuite is limited, and its API notoriously complicated. Fivetranâ€™s NetSuite analytics template removes these obstacles, allowing users to analyze and visualize data quickly. Within minutes, analysts can utilize pre-built dashboards to analyze the following:
* Financial statements: Income Statement and Balance Sheet
* Sales: quickly understand where your sales are coming from and which items are best sellers
* Expenses: View your expenses by department, accounts or location.

## Post-Installation ##
This block can be extended for specific business needs or to incorporate additional data sources alongside Netsuite data. To accomplish this, Refinements are required.
